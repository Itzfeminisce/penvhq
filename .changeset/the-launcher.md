**New:** `penv` is a launcher, and the engine it runs is the one your project pins.

Install it once — `npm install -g penv` — and it stays put. Inside a project it reads `.penv/state/manifest.json`, finds that exact engine and those exact extensions in `$PENV_HOME` (`~/.penv` unless you move it), checks them against the integrity the manifest records, and hands your command to them with the arguments, streams, exit code and signals untouched. Outside a project it runs `init` on the engine it shipped with. There is one version to read: `penv --version` prints the pinned engine inside a project and the bundled one outside.

Missing bytes are a refusal, not a surprise download. In CI, in production, or under `--no-download`, penv names `penv install` — the preinstall step that materializes exactly what the manifest pins — and stops. At an interactive terminal it offers to download once, from the registry the manifest records, and verifies the tarball before a single file is written.

`@penvhq/cli` now publishes a `penv-engine` bin, which is what the launcher spawns.
